# Getting Started

You may need to set up a separate Django Application using the django-rest framework, the app should be using a PostgreSQL database. 

We try to use a decentralized approach so your Django and Angular application should be able to operate completely independently of each other. They should also be kept in separate repositories.

Here are some tutorials to get you started:
