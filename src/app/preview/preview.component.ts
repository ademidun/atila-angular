My current options are Health Studies, Kinesiology, and Medical Science.\r\n\r\n I know that Iâ€™m interested in science and the health care field in general, but I don't want to box myself into any specific career at this point in time. I want to explore and do some shadowing before I decide on a professional program (i.e. physical therapy, pharmacy, medicine and dentistry) or other graduate studies.\r\n\r\nI am leaning towards Medical Science, but I'm concerned that if I decide not to do Medicine, I won't have anything to fall back on. That being said, are there any tips or advice anyone has for selecting a program in this beginning stage of my post-secondary pathway?\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate the perspective of individuals currently in these respective fields of study or in their practice. What are three things that you like about the field, and three things you dislike about it?",

The schools I'm looking at offer SE and CE as a second-year option, which is available after a general first year. My interest lies mostly in software, but I'd also like to learn the hardware side of it computer systems as well. \n\nIf I take CS, on the off chance that I donâ€™t like it, I donâ€™t want to end up in a position where I can only do another math/science major. \n\nWith the general year, however, if I just end up picking software anyways I think I would feel as if I wasted that year when I could have had a year of coding down in CS. With that year of coding, I could be looking at working for a term or I could focus on building my own project portfolio.\n\nSo, in general: If I take general engineering first I may be able to drop into CS, but I would be behind. But if I donâ€™t like CS I canâ€™t go into engineering at all. Which major should I pick if my goal right now is to work in software? ",
